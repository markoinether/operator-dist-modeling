# Overview

This is a modeling of different operator & staker distribution topologies. It is trying to find & visualize answers to these questions:

What is the distribution of operator collateral? <br /> How much of it is concentrated in each percentile? <br /> At what percentile do we get $x$ % of the collateral in the network?

# Data sources

# Run it

You need python, together with very few native libs.
